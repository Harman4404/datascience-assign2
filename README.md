Description:
This repository contains a Python script for evaluating machine learning models using various sampling techniques to address class imbalance. The code utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn.

Features:

Evaluates multiple machine learning models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) on a given dataset.
Implements different sampling techniques (Random Oversampling, Random Undersampling) to handle class imbalance.
Displays accuracy results in a formatted table for easy interpretation.
